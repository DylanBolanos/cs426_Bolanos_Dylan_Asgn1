CS426 @UIC: Assignment 1 (Living in the City) My assignment follows the theme of living in the city with mutiple types of buildings present, and using floral colors recrating "Flowers" as the target. I included nessesery stores and residential living spaces. Some small decorations like trees and rocks to add a little bit more life into the small city I made.
